Get rid of default email from like this wordpress@domain.com, use your own brand name!

== Description ==

Change your WordPress default sender email ID to your own to look like more professional.
By default it is wordpress@domain.com but right now using this plugin you may change the name of the sender and the from email address too.
The main benefit you will get that, sometimes your default WordPress email address looks like spam to gmail, hotmail, yahoo mail or other email clients and they push your email to junk or spam folder. By using this plugin you can avoid that situation easily and you can use your brand name in from name and from email address too.
